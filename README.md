# Student-counsellor-cpp

Student counsellor â€“ You have to create two classes Student class (you can use the one you implemented in
previous assignment) and Counsellor class. Counsellor class will contain basic counsellor information along with an
array of students assigned to that counsellor. You will need to write three files (Counsellor.h, Counsellor.cpp and
Q4.cpp). Create an array of counsellors in the main function and then students will be assigned to counsellors. Each
counsellor can have different number of students. Details of functions that you need to implement are given below.
Your implemented class must fully provide the definitions of following class (interface) functions. Please also write
down the test code to drive your class implementation. Please note that we will be running your code against our test
code and any segmentation faults or incorrect result will result in loss of marks.
